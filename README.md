# Application 6 – Project Demo

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site for **Application 6**!  
This page contains a short description of the project and an embedded demo video.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates real-time hazard detection using an ESP32, gas sensor, ADC conversion, and threshold-based alerting. The system reads live sensor values, converts them to ppm, and displays the hazard level.

The goal of this assignment is to:
- Host a simple GitHub Pages website  
- Embed a short YouTube demo video  
- Provide a clean public link to show the project
