## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time combustible gas detection system intended for use aboard a Lockheed Martin aircraft. 
In a normal operating environment, the aircraft should never register combustible gases within the cabin, as the presence of such gases 
would indicate a potentially dangerous system leak or failure. The onboard MQ-2 sensor continuously monitors gas concentration levels, 
and the system evaluates these readings against a strict threshold of 5000 ppm, chosen to represent the onset of hazardous conditions.
